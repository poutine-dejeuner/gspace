### Introduction

Intelligent systems need perception to understand, predict, and navigate their
environment. These sensory capabilities reflect what's useful for survival in
a specific environment: bats use echolocation, migratory birds sense magnetic
fields, Arctic reindeer shift their UV vision seasonally. But when your world
is made of text, what do you see? Language models encounter many text-based
tasks that benefit from visual or spatial reasoning: parsing ASCII art,
interpreting tables, or handling text wrapping constraints. Yet their only
“sensory” input is a sequence of integers representing tokens. They must learn
perceptual abilities from scratch, developing specialized mechanisms in the
process.

In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that enable Claude 3.5 Haiku to
perform a natural perceptual task which is common in pretraining corpora and
involves tracking position in a document. We find learned representations of
position that are in some ways quite similar to the biological neurons found
in mammals who perform analogous tasks (“place cells” and “boundary cells” in
mice), but in other ways unique to the constraints of the residual stream in
language models. We study these representations and find dual interpretations:
we can understand them as a family of discrete features or as a one-
dimensional “feature manifold”/“multidimensional feature” .All features have a
magnitude dimension; so a discrete feature is a one-dimensional ray, and a
one-dimensional feature manifold is the set of all scalings of that manifold,
contracting to the origin. See [What is a Linear Representation? What is a
Multidimensional Feature?](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/july-
update/index.html#linear-representations) In the first interpretation,
position is determined by which features activate and how strongly; in the
latter interpretation, it's determined by angular movement on the feature
manifold. Similarly, computation has two dual interpretations, as discrete
circuits or geometric transformations.

The task we study is linebreaking in fixed-width text. When training on source
code, chat logs, email archives, scanned articles, or judicial rulings that
have line width constraints, how does the model learn to predict when to break
a line? Michaud et al. looked for “quanta” of model skills by clustering
gradients . Their Figure 1 shows that predicting newlines in fixed-width text
formed one of the top 400 clusters for the smallest model in the Pythia
family, with 70m parameters. Human visual perception lets us do this almost
completely subconsciously – when writing a birthday card, you can see when you
are out of room on a line and need to begin the next – but language models see
just a list of integers. In order to correctly predict the next token, in
addition to selecting the next word, the model must somehow count the
characters in the current line, subtract that from the line width constraint
of the document, and compare the number of characters remaining to the length
of the next word. As a concrete example, consider the below pair of prompts
with an implicit 50-character line wrapping constraint.The wrapping constraint
is implicit. Each newline gives a lower bound (the previous word did fit) and
an upper bound (the next word did not). We do not nail down the extent to
which the model performs optimal inference with respect to those constraints,
rather focusing on how it approximately uses the length of each preceding line
to determine whether to break the next. There are also many edge cases for
handling tokenization and punctuation. A model could even attempt to infer
whether the source document used a non-monospace font and then use the pixel
count rather than the character count as a predictive signal! When the next
word fits, the model says it; when it does not, the model breaks the line:

[IMAGE]

To orient ourselves to the stages of the computation, we first studied the
model using discrete dictionary features. In this frame, we can understand
computation as an “attribution graph”  where a cascade of features excite or
inhibit each other.We actually first tried to use patching and probing without
looking at the graph as a kind of methodological test of the utility of
features, but did not make much progress. In hindsight, we were training
probes for quantities different than the ones the model represents cleanly,
e.g., a fusion of the current token position and the line width.

[IMAGE]Attribution Graph for Claude 3.5 Haiku’s prediction of a newline in the
aluminum prompt. We see features relating to “width of the previous line” and
“position in the current line” which together activate features for “distance
from line limit”. Combined with features for the planned next word, these
features activate “predict newline” features.

The attribution graph shows how the model performs this task by combining
features that represent different concepts it needs to track:

  1. Features for the current position in the line (the character count) as well as features for the total line width (the constraint) are computed by accumulating features for individual token lengths.
  2. The model then combines these two representations — current position and line width — to estimate the distance from the end of the line, leading to “characters remaining” features.
  3. Finally, the model uses this estimate of characters remaining along with features for the planned next word to determine if the next word will fit on the line or not.

The attribution graph provides a kind of execution trace of the algorithm,
showing on this prompt which variables are computed and from what. After
finding large feature families involved in representing these quantities
across a diverse dataset, we suspected a simpler lens might be provided in
terms of lower-dimensional feature manifolds interacting geometrically. We
found geometric perspectives on the following questions:

[IMAGE]Key steps in the linebreaking behavior can be described in terms of the
construction and manipulation of manifolds.

How does the model represent different counts? The number of characters in a
token, the number of characters in the current line, the overall line width
constraint, and the number of characters remaining in the current line are
each represented on 1-dimensional feature manifolds embedded with high
curvature in low-dimensional subspaces of the residual stream. These manifolds
have a dual interpretation in terms of discrete features, which tile the
manifold in a canonical way, providing approximate local coordinates.
Manifolds with similar geometry arise for a variety of ordinal concepts, and a
ringing pattern we see in the embedded geometry in all these cases is optimal
with respect to a simple physical model (§Representing Character
Count).Ringing, in the manifold perspective, corresponds to interference in
the feature superposition perspective.

How does the model detect the boundary? To detect an approaching line
boundary, the model must compare two quantities: the current character count
and the line width. We find attention heads whose QK matrix rotates one
counting manifold to align it with the other at a specific offset, creating a
large inner product when the difference of the counts falls within a target
range. Multiple heads with different offsets work together to precisely
estimate the characters remaining (§Sensing the Line Boundary).

How does the model know if the next word fits? The final decision — whether to
predict a newline — requires combining the estimate of characters remaining
with the length of the predicted next word. We discover that the model
positions these counts on near-orthogonal subspaces, creating a geometric
structure where the correct linebreak prediction is linearly separable
(§Predicting the Newline).

How does the model construct these curved geometries? The curvature in the
character count representation manifold is produced by many attention heads
working together, each contributing a piece of the overall curvature. This
distributed algorithm is necessary because individual components cannot
generate sufficient output variance to create the full representation (§A
Distributed Character Counting Algorithm).

We validate these interpretations through targeted interventions, ablations,
and “visual illusions” — character sequences that hijack specific attention
mechanisms to disrupt spatial perception (§Visual Illusions).

Zooming out, we take several broader lessons from this mechanistic case study:

When Models Manipulate Manifolds. For representing a scalar quantity (e.g.,
integer counts from 1 to N), it is inefficient to use N orthogonal dimensions,
and not expressive enough to use just oneOrthogonal dimensions would also not
be robust to estimation noise.. Instead models learn to represent these
quantities on a feature manifold with intrinsic dimension 1 (the count)
embedded in a subspace with extrinsic dimension 1 < d \ll N (e.g., ), in which
the curve “ripples”. Such rippled manifolds optimally trade off capacity
constraints (roughly, dimensionality) with maintaining the distinguishability
of different scalar values (curvature). Our work demonstrates the intricate
ways in which these manifolds can be manipulated to perform computation and
show how this can require distributing computation across multiple model
components.

Duality of Features and Geometry. Dictionary features provide an unsupervised
entry point for discovering mechanisms, and attribution graphs surface the
important features for any particular prediction. Sometimes, discrete features
(and their interactions) can be equivalently described using continuous
feature manifolds (and their transformations). In cases where it is possible
to explicitly parameterize the manifold (as with the various integer counts we
study), we can directly study the geometry, making some operations clearer
(e.g., boundary detection). But this approach is expensive in researcher time
and potentially limited in scope: it's straightforward when studying known
continuous variables but becomes difficult to execute correctly for more
complex, difficult-to-parametrize concepts.

Complexity Tax. While unsupervised discovery is a victory in and of itself,
dictionary features fragment the model into a multitude of small pieces and
interactions – a kind of complexity tax on the interpretation. In cases where
a manifold parametrization exists, we can think of the geometric description
as reducing this tax. In other cases, we will need additional tools to reduce
the interpretation burden, like hierarchical representations  or macroscopic
structure in the global weights . We would be excited to see methods that
extend the dictionary learning paradigm to unsupervised discovery of other
kinds of geometric structures (e.g., those found in prior work ).

Natural Tasks. The crispness of the representations and circuits we found was
quite striking, and may be due to how well the model does the task.
Linebreaking is an extremely natural behavior for a pretrained language model,
and even tiny models are capable of it given enough context. Studying tasks
which are natural for pretrained language models, instead of those of more
theoretical interest to human investigators, may offer promising targets for
finding general mechanisms.

#### Preliminaries

To enable systematic analysis, we created a synthetic dataset using a text
corpus of diverse prose where we (1) stripped out all newlines and (2)
reinserted newlines every k characters to the nearest word boundary \leq k for
k=15,20,\ldots,150. As an example, here is the opening sentence of the
Gettysburg Address, wrapped to k=40 characters, with the newlines shown
explicitly.

Four score and seven years ago our⏎

fathers brought forth on this continent,⏎

a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and⏎

dedicated to the proposition that all⏎

men are created equal.

Claude 3.5 Haiku is able to adapt to the line length for every value of k,
predicting newlines at the correct positions with high probability by the
third line (see Appendix).

All features in the main text of this paper are from a 10 million feature
Weakly Causal Crosscoder (WCC) dictionary  trained on Claude 3.5 Haiku.
Feature activation values are normalized to their max throughout.

### Representing Character Count

We define the line character count (or character count) at a given token in a
prompt to be the total number of characters since the last newline, including
the characters of the current token.

A natural thing to check is if the model linearly represents the character
count as a quantitative variable: that is, can we predict character count with
high accuracy via linear regression on the residual stream? Yes: a linear
probe fit on the residual stream after layer 1 has an R^2 of 0.985. This
success does not mean, however, that the model actually represents the
character count along a single line.

Instead, we find a multidimensional representation of the character count that
we will analyze from four perspectives:

  1. Sparse crosscoder features.Each feature has an encoder, which acts as a linear + (Jump)ReLU probe on the residual stream, and a decoder. Ten features f_1,\ldots,f_{10} are associated with line character count. The model's estimate of the character count, given a residual stream vector x, is summarized by the set of activities of each of the 10 features \\{f_i(x)\\}.
  2. A low-dimensional subspace.The model's estimate of the character count is summarized by the projection \pi(x) of x onto that subspace. Two datapoints have similar character counts if their projections are close in that subspace.
  3. A continuous 1-dimensional manifold contained in that low-dimensional subspace.The model's estimate of the character count is summarized by the nearest point on the manifold to the projection of x into the subspace, and its confidence in that estimate by the magnitude of \pi(x).
  4. A set of 150 logistic probes (corresponding to values of line character count from 1 to 150).The model's estimate of the character count is summarized by the probability distribution given by the softmax of the probe activities, softmax(Px).

Each of these perspectives provides a complementary view of the same
underlying object. The feature perspective is valuable for getting oriented,
the subspace is perfect for causal intervention, the manifold is helpful for
understanding how the representation is constructed and then manipulated to
detect boundaries, and the logistic probes are useful for analyzing the OV and
QK matrices of the individual attention heads involved.

#### Character Count Features

We begin with the features. In layers one and two, we found features that
seemed to activate based on a token’s character position within a line. For
example, in the attribution graph for the aluminum prompt, there were two
features active on the final word “called” that seemed to fire when the line
character count was between 35–55 and 45–65, respectively. To find more such
features, we computed the mean activation of each feature binned by line
character count. There were ten features with smooth profiles and large
between-character-count variance, shown below:

[IMAGE]A family of features representing the current character count in a line of
text. The tuning curve of the features’ activity increases at larger line
character counts.

We find these features especially interesting as they are quite analogous to
curve-detector features in vision models  and place cells in biological brains
. In all three of these cases, a continuous variable is represented by a
collection of discrete elements that activate for particular value ranges.
Moreover, we also observe dilation of the receptive fields (i.e., subsequent
features activate over increasingly large character ranges) which is a common
characteristic of biological perception of numbers (e.g., ).

In the Appendix, we show these features are universal across dictionaries of
different sizes, but that some feature splitting occurs with respect to the
line width constraint.

#### The Model Represents Character Count on a Continuous Manifold

We observe that character count feature activations rise and fall at an
offset, with two features being active at a time for most counts. This pattern
suggests that the features are reconstructing a curved continuous manifold,
locally parametrized by the activity of the two most active features. Given
that their joint activation profiles follow a sinusoidal pattern, we expect
reconstructions to lie on a curve between adjacent feature decoders.

To visualize this, we first compute the average layer 2 residual stream for
each value of line character count on our synthetic dataset. We compute the
PCA of these 150 vectors, and find that the top 6 components capture 95% of
the variance; we project data to that 6 dimensional subspace which we call the
“character count subspace” (top 3 PCs on the left below, next 3 PCs on the
right). We observe the data form a twisting curve, resembling a helix from the
perspective of PCs 1–3 and a more complex twist from the perspective of PCs
4–6.

We also reconstruct the residual stream for each datapoint using only the 10
character count features identified above, and compute the average
reconstructed residual stream. We project the resulting curve, along with the
feature decoders, into the same subspace. We find that the average line
character count vectors are quite closely approximated by the feature
reconstruction, though with mild kinks near the feature vectors themselves,
reminiscent of a spline approximation of a smooth curve. While the 10 feature
vectors discretize the curve, interpolating between the 2–3 neighboring
features which are active at a time allows for a high-quality reconstruction
of 150 data points.

Character count is represented on a manifold in a 6 dimensional subspace
(jagged line). This manifold can be approximately locally parametrized by the
features we identified (crosses).

#### Validation: The Character Count Subspace is Causal

To validate our interpretation of the character count subspace, we perform a
coarse-grained ablation and a fine-grained intervention.

Ablation Experiment. For our ablation experiment, we zero ablate (from a
single early layer) a k-dimensional subspace corresponding to the top k
principal components of the per–character count mean activations and compare
to a baseline of ablating a random k-dimensional subspace. Below we measure
the loss effect, broken down by newlines and nonnewlines.Note, in general one
should not assume that a subspace spanned by features (or a PCA) is dedicated
to those features because it could be in superposition with many other
features. However, because in this case the character count subspace is
densely active (and therefore less amenable to being in superposition), this
experimental design is more justified.

[IMAGE]Ablating the character count subspace has a large effect only when the next
token is a newline.

Intervention Experiment. As a more surgical intervention, we perform an
experiment to modify the perceived character count at the end of the aluminum
prompt (originally 42 characters). Specifically, we sweep over character
counts c, and substitute the mean activation across all tokens in our dataset
with count c. That is, a_{\text{patched}} = a_{\text{original}} -
\mu_{\text{original}} + \mu_{c} for activation a and average activation matrix
\mu. We perform this intervention for three adjacent early layers and the last
two tokens for both the entire mean vector and within the 6 dimensional PCA
space of the mean vectors. The attribution graph has several positional
features and edges on both the last token (“called”) as well as the second-to-
last token (“also”). We change the “also” count representation to be 6
characters prior to that for the final token, to maintain consistency.

[IMAGE]Intervening on a rank 6 subspace is sufficient to change the model’s
linebreaking behavior.

#### The Probe Perspective

We also train supervised logistic regression probes to predict character
count.as a 150-way multiclass classification problem Probes trained after
layer 1 achieve a root mean squared error of 5, indicating some intrinsic
noise in the character count representation — which is consistent with our
features having relatively wide receptive fields. Performing PCA on the 150
probe weight vectors, we find that 6 components capture 82% of the variance.

When we look at the average responses of each probe to tokens with different
line character counts, we see a striking pattern. In addition to a diagonal
band (probes, like the sparse features, have increasingly wide receptive
fields), we see two faint off-diagonal bands on each side! The response curve
of each probe is not monotonically decreasing away from its max, but rebounds.
This “ringing” turns out to be a natural consequence of embedding a “rippled”
manifold into low dimensions.

[IMAGE]Response curve of Line Character Count probes as a function of Line Character
Count show widening receptive fields and a "ringing" pattern of off-diagonal
stripes.

#### Rippled Representations are Optimal

We note that the cosine similarities of the mean activation vector (which form
the helix-like curve visualized in PCA space above), the linear probe vectors,
and feature decoder vectors all exhibit similar ringing patterns to the above
figure.We use the term
“[ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_\(signal\))” in the sense of
signal processing, a transient oscillation in response to a sharp peak, such
as in the Gibbs Phenomenon. Note that not only are neighboring features not
orthogonal, features further away have negative similarities, and then those
even further away have positive ones again.

[IMAGE]

This structure turns out to be a natural consequence of having the desired
pattern of similarity, trivially achievable in 150 dimensions, projected down
to low dimensions. As a toy model of this, suppose that we wish to have a
discretized circle's worth of unit vectors, each similar to its neighbors but
orthogonal to those further away. This can be realized by a symmetric set of
unit vectors in 150 dimensions with cosine similarity matrix X pictured below
(left). Projecting this to its top 5 eigenvectors yields a 5-dimensional
embedding of the same vectors with cosine similarity matrix (below right)
exhibiting ringing. We also plot the curve these vectors form in the top 3
eigenvectors. We can think of the original 150-dimensional embedding of the
circle as being highly curved, and the resulting 5-dimensional embedding as
retaining as much of that curvature as possible. This manifests as ripples in
the embedding of the circle when viewed in a 3D projection. A relationship of
this construction to Fourier features is discussed in the appendix.

[IMAGE]Left panel shows an ideal similarity matrix for vectors representing points
along a circle. Middle panel shows the optimal (PCA) approximation possible
when embedding the points in 5 dimensions. Right panel shows the resulting
projection of the circle to the top 3 dimensions, exhibiting rippling.

Alternatively, one can view the ringing from the perspective of sparse feature
decoders as a kind of interference weight . With no capacity constraints, the
model might use orthogonal vectors to represent the quantitative response of
each feature, with its own receptive field, to the input data. Forced to put
them into lower dimensional superposition, the similarity matrix picks up both
a wider diagonal stripe and the upper/lower diagonal ringing stripes.

Finally, we also construct a simple physical model showing that the rippling
and ringing arise even when the solution is found dynamically, whenever many
vectors are packed into a small number of dimensions. Below, we show the
result of a simulation in which 100 points confined to a 6-dimensional
hypersphere are subjected to attractive forces to their 6 closest neighbors on
each side (matching the RMSE error of our probes) and repulsive forces to all
other points. (To avoid boundary conditions, we use the topology of a circle
instead of an interval.) On the right below is a heatmap exhibiting two rings,
and on the left is a 3-dimensional projection of the 6-dimensional curve. This
simulation is interactive, and the reader is encouraged to experiment with
reinitializing the points (↺), switching the ambient dimension, and modifying
the width of the attractive zone. Decreasing the attractive zone or increasing
the embedding dimension both increase curvature (and the amount of ringing),
and vice versa.The simulation can sometimes find itself in local minima.
Increasing the width of the attractive zone before decreasing it again usually
solves this issue. As the number of points on the curve grows and the
attractive zone width shrinks (in relative terms), the curvature grows quite
extreme, approaching a space-filling curve in the limit.

Of particular interest is the result from setting the ambient dimension to
3Optimization in dimension 3, unlike in higher dimensions, admits bad local
minima, because a generic curve on the surface of a sphere self-intersects. To
avoid this, either increase the zone width until you get a great circle, then
decrease it, or do the optimization in 4D, then select 3D.: the result is a
curve similar to the seams of a baseball (below left, circle), which matches
the topology observed for three intrinsically one-dimensional phenomena
observed in , of colors by hue, dates of the year, and years of the 20th
century (which also exhibit dilation). Similar ripples were predicted to occur
by Olah  and then observed by Gorton  in curve detector features in Inception
v1. One of the earliest observations of ringing in a cosine similarity plot
and rippled spiral/helix shape in a low-dimensional embedding was of the
learned positional embeddings of tokens in GPT2 . We also find similar
structure in other representations, which we study in More Sensory and
Counting Representations in the appendix.

### Sensing the Line Boundary

We now study how the character counting representations are used to determine
if the current line of text is approaching the line boundary. To detect the
line boundary, the model needs to (1) determine the overall line width
constraint and (2) compare the current character count with the line width to
calculate the characters remaining.

#### Twisting with QK

We find that newline tokens have their own dedicated character counting
features that activate based on the width of the line, counting the number of
characters between adjacent newlines.

To better understand how these representations are related, we train 150
probes for each possible value of “Line Width” like we did for “Character
Count”. Using the attribution graph, we identify an attention head which
activates boundary detection features. We visualize both sets of counting
representations directly using the first 3 components of their joint PCA in
the residual stream (left) and in the reduced QK space of this boundary head
(right).Specifically we multiply the line width probes through W_K and the
character count probes through W_Q, and plot the points in the 3D PCA basis of
their joint embedding.

Boundary heads twist the representation of line width and character count to
detect the line boundary.  
Left: Joint PCA of character count and line width probes.  
Right: Same after multiplying them through the corresponding QK weights of the
boundary head. Range is from 40 (dark) to 150 (light).

We find that this attention head “twists” the character count manifold such
that character count i is aligned with line width k=i+\epsilon. This causes
the head to attend to the newline when the character count is just a bit less
than the line width, thereby indicating that the boundary is approaching. This
algorithm is quite general, and enables this head to detect approaching line
boundaries for arbitrary line widths!This algorithm also generalizes to
arbitrary kinds of separators (e.g., double newlines or pipes), as the QK
circuit can handle the positional offset independently of the OV circuit
copying the separator type.

[IMAGE]Cosine similarity of previous line width and character count probes through
different transforms. (Left) the identity map, (Center) QK of boundary head,
(Right) QK of random head in the same layer. Boundary heads align the probes
but with a small offset.

This plot shows that

  * In the residual stream, probes for character count i are maximally aligned with line width probes k when i=k, but are not highly aligned in absolute terms – the maximum cosine sim is ~0.25. 
  * In the QK space of the boundary head, the probes are maximally aligned on the off-diagonal i < k, and are almost perfectly aligned in absolute terms – the maximum cosine sim is \approx 1.
  * In the QK space of a random head, there is almost no structure between the probes.

As a consequence of the ringing in the character count representations, we
also observe ringing in the inner products (see Rippled Representations are
Optimal above). The model is robust to these off-diagonal interference terms
via the softmax applied to attention scores.

#### Leveraging Multiple Boundary Heads

We find that the model actually uses multiple boundary heads, each twisting
the manifolds by a different offset to implement a kind of “stereoscopic”
algorithm for computing the number of characters remaining.There are also
multiple sets of boundary heads at multiple layers that usually come in sets
of ~3 with similar relative offsets (so not actually “stereo”). We attach more
visualizations of boundary heads in the Appendix.

[IMAGE]Cosine similarity of line width and character count probes through three
different boundary heads in the same layer with different amounts of twisting.
Green line indicates the argmax for each row, and is used to calculate the
average offset reported in the subtitles.

To better understand each boundary head’s output, we train a set of probes for
each value of characters remaining in the line (i.e., the line width k minus
the character count i, restricted to k - i < 40). For each boundary head, we
show the proportion of attention on the newline, as well as the norm of each
head’s output projected onto the probe space as a function of characters
remaining.

As predicted by our weights based analysis, we observe that boundary heads
have distinct but overlapping response curves that “tile” the possible values
of characters remaining.

[IMAGE]Each boundary head’s response curve peaks at a different distance from the
end of the line.

It's worth understanding why the model needs multiple boundary heads rather
than just one. If the model relied only on boundary head 0, it couldn't
distinguish between 5 characters remaining and 17 characters remaining—both
would produce similar outputs. By having each head's output vary most
significantly in different ranges, their sum achieves high resolution across
the entire relevant range of “Characters Remaining” values.

We can see this more clearly by plotting each head's output in the first two
principal components of the characters remaining space (which captures 92% of
the variance). Head 0 shows large variance in the [0, 10] and [15, 20] ranges,
Head 1 varies most in the [10, 20] range, and Head 2 varies most in the [5,
15] range. While no single head provides high resolution across the entire
curve, their sum produces an evenly spaced representation that covers all
values effectively.

[IMAGE]Each head’s output as a function of characters remaining, and their sum in
the PCA basis. Individual head outputs are almost one-dimensional, while the
sum is a two-dimensional curve.

We validate the causal importance of this two-dimensional subspace by
performing an ablation and intervention experiment. Specifically, we conduct
the same experiments as before: ablate the subspace and measure its effect on
loss by token (left) and precisely modulate the characters remaining estimate
on the last token in the aluminum prompt by substituting mean activation
vectors.

[IMAGE]Characters remaining subspace can be causally intervened upon. (Left)
Ablating the subspace has a large effect only when the next token is a
newline. (Right) We surgically intervene on the characters remaining space to
modulate the prediction of the newline by subtracting the true characters
remaining mean activation and adding in a patched characters remaining
activations. Note that the completion “ aluminum.” requires ten characters to
fit.

#### The Role of the Extra Dimensions

We are now in a position to understand two distinct but related questions: (1)
why these counting representations are multidimensional and (2) why multiple
attention heads are required to compute these multidimensional
representations.

Geometric Computations – A multi-dimensional representation enables the model
to rotate position encodings using linear transformations—something impossible
with one-dimensional representations. For instance, to detect an approaching
line boundary, the model can rotate the position manifold to align with line
width, then use a dot product to identify when only a few characters remain.
With a 1D encoding, linear operations reduce to scaling and translation, so
comparing position against line width would just multiply the two values,
producing a monotonically increasing result with no natural threshold. Higher
dimensions beyond 2D allow the manifold to pack more information through
additional curvature.

Resolution – For character counting, the model must distinguish between
adjacent counts for a large range of character positions, as this determines
whether the next word fits. In a one-dimensional representation, positions
would be arranged along a ray, with each position separated by some constant
\delta. To reliably distinguish adjacent positions above noise, we need
||v_{42} - v_{41}|| = \delta to exceed some threshold. But with 150+ positions
to represent, this creates an untenable choice: either use enormous dynamic
range (||v_{150}|| \gg ||v_1||), which is problematic for transformer
computations, or sacrifice resolution between adjacent positions.
(Normalization blocks only exacerbate this effect: while points can be spaced
far away on a ray if their norms get large enough, there is at most \pi worth
of angular distance along the projection of that ray onto the unit
hypersphere.) Embedding the curve into higher dimensions solves this:
positions maintain similar norms while being well-separated in the ambient
space, achieving fine resolution without norm explosion (See Rippled
Representations are Optimal above.) For counting the characters remaining, the
dynamic range is smaller, and so the model is able to embed the representation
in a smaller subspace as a result.

To achieve the curvature for necessary high resolution, multiple attention
heads are needed to cooperatively construct the curved geometry of the
counting manifold. An individual attention head's output is a linear
combination of its inputs (weighted by attention and transformed by the OV
circuit), and thus is fundamentally constrained by the curvature already
present in those inputs. In the absence of MLP contributions to the counting
representation, if the output manifold needs to exhibit substantial curvature,
multiple attention heads need to coordinate—each contributing a piece of the
overall geometric structure. We will see another example of distributed head
computation in the section on the Distributed Character Counting Algorithm.

#### A Discovery Story

How did we originally find this boundary detection mechanism? When we first
computed an attribution graph, we saw several edges from the previous newline
features and embedding to predict-newline features. QK attributions showed
that the top key feature was a “the previous line was 40–60 characters long”
feature and the top query feature was “the current character count is 35–50”
feature. At any one time there were often multiple counting features active at
different strengths, suggesting that these features might be discretizing a
manifold.

[IMAGE]

The boundary heads cause a family of boundary detecting features to activate
in response to how close the current line is to the global line width. That
is, they sense the approaching line boundary or the reverse index of the line
count. Investigating these three sets of feature families led us to the count
manifolds which they sparsely parametrize, and investigating the relevant
attention heads let us find the boundary heads.

Finally, we note that these boundary-sensing representations parallel a well-
studied phenomenon in neuroscience: boundary cells , which activate at
specific distances from environmental boundaries (e.g., walls). Both the
artificial features and biological cells come in families with varied
receptive fields and offsets.

### Predicting the Newline

The final step of the linebreak task is to combine the estimate of the line
boundary with the prediction of the next word to determine whether the next
word will fit on the line, or if the line should be broken.

In the attribution graph for the aluminum prompt, we see exactly this merging
of paths. The most influential featureInfluence in the sense of influence on
the logit node, as defined in Ameisen et al.  in the entire graph is a late
feature that activates in contexts where the next word would cause the current
line to exceed the overall line width. For our prompt, this feature upweights
the probability of newline and downweights the probability of “aluminum.” The
top two inputs to this break predictor feature are a “say aluminum” feature
and “boundary detecting” feature that gets activated by the aforementioned
boundary head.

[IMAGE]

While the boundary detector activates regardless of the next token length,
break predictor features activate only if the next token will exceed the
length of the current line (as in the Aluminum prompt), and hence upweight the
prediction of a newline.These features also sometimes activate on zero-width
modifier tokens (e.g., a token which indicates the first letter of the
following token should be capitalized) that need to be adjacent to the
modified token, and the modified token is sufficiently long to go over the
line limit (e.g. for “Aluminum” instead of “aluminum”). We also see break
suppressor features, which only activate if the next token would just barely
fit on the line, and hence downweight the prediction of a newline. Both break
predictors and suppressors come in larger feature families, which we display
in the Appendix.

[IMAGE]Average activations of three features based on true next token character
length and the characters remaining in a line (line width − character count).

#### Joint Geometry Enables Easy Computation

What is the geometry underlying the model’s ability to determine if the next
token will fit on the line? Put another way, how is the break predictor
feature above constructed from the boundary detector and next-word features?

To study this, we compute the average activations at the end of the model
(~90% depth) across all tokens for all values of characters remaining i and
next token lengths j.We use the true next non-newline token as the label. This
is an approximation because it assumes that the model perfectly predicts the
next token.  By performing a PCA on the combination of mean vectors, we see
that the two counts are arranged in orthogonal subspaces with only moderate
curvature. Note, this lower dimensional geometry may suffice here because the
dynamic range of the count is much smaller.

Low dimensional projections of next token character length and characters
remaining counting manifolds for 1 (dark) to 15 (light) characters.  
(Left) The PCA of their union. (Right) The PCA of all their pairwise
combinations.  
The orthogonal representations make the correct newline decision linearly
separable.

Now consider the pairwise sum of each possible character-remaining vector i
and next-token-length vector j.This sum is principled because both sets of
vectors are marginalized data means, so collectively have the mean of the
data, which we center to be 0. Since these counts are arranged orthogonally,
the decision to break the line i-j \geq 0 corresponds to a simple separating
hyperplane. In other words, the prediction to break the line is made trivial
by the underlying geometry!

When we use the separating hyperplane from the PCA of these average embeddings
on real data, we achieve an AUC of 0.91 on the ground truth of whether the
next token should be a newline. This reflects both the error of the three
dimensional classifier and the error from Haiku’s estimates of the next token.

If the length of the most likely next word is linearly represented, this
scheme would allow the model to predict newlines when that word is longer than
the length remaining in the line. One could imagine a more general mechanism
where the model comprehensively redirects the probability mass from all words
that exceed the line limit to the newline. Claude 3.5 Haiku does not seem to
leverage such a mechanism: when we compare the predicted distribution of
tokens at the end of a line to the distribution on an identical prompt with
the newlines stripped, we find them to be quite different.

### A Distributed Character Counting Algorithm

Having described how the various character counting representations are used,
the last big remaining question is: how are they computed?

We will show how Haiku uses many attention heads across multiple layers to
cooperatively compute an increasingly accurate estimate of the character
count. This turned out to be the most complicated mechanism we studied, though
there are many similarities with the boundary detection mechanism.

To get an intuitive understanding of the behavior of the heads important for
counting, we project their outputs into the PCA space of the line character
count probes.We display the average outputs over many prompts. Layer 0 heads
(left) each write along what appears as a ray when visualized in the first 3
principal components—it is their sum that generates a curved manifold. Layer 1
heads (right) instead output curves which combine to produce an increasingly
complex manifold. They appear responsible for sharpening the Layer 0
representation and thus the estimate of the count. We find that the R^2 for
the character count prediction The prediction is the argmax of the head
outputs projected on the character count probes. of the 5 key Layer 0 heads is
0.93, compared to 0.97 using 11 heads in the first two layers.

Comparison of Layer 0 (left) vs Layer 1 (right) average attention outputs in
the PCA basis of the character count probes from 1 (dark) to 150 (light)
characters. In each layer, the outputs from each head tile the space.  
In Layer 0, each head output is almost 1-dimensional, while in Layer 1 heads
display more curvature (which they got from Layer 0!).

#### Embedding Geometry

To understand how the character count is computed, we start at the very
beginning: the embedding matrix.

As before, we can train probes or compute the average weights for every
distinct token length in the embedding. We visualize the token character count
probes for character length 1–14 and visualize their top principal components.
Using the first 3 principal components, which capture 70% of the variance, we
see that embedding character counts are arranged in a circular pattern (PC1 vs
PC2) with an oscillating component (PC3). This pattern is consistent with the
ones observed in Rippled Representations are Optimal.

[IMAGE]PCA of embedding vectors in W_E averaged by token character length.

As with all of the counting manifolds, we also find features that discretize
this space into overlapping notions of short, medium, and long words.

#### Attention Head Outputs Sum To Produce the Count

To understand the counting mechanism, we will work backwards from the summed
attention outputs to the embedding. Notably, we:

  * Ignore MLPs – The attention head outputs affect the character count representation 4× more than the MLPs, so we restrict our focus to attention;
  * Focus on First Two Layers – Even after layer 0, counting probes have reasonable accuracy and there are coarse positional features. Therefore, we focus on how attention transforms the embeddings into the count and how layer 1 further refines this representation.

The inner product of the summed attention outputs and the character counting
probes; (Right) How the argmax of this product compares to the true line
count. Context position starts at the first newline, with newlines denoted
with dashes.

We can decompose the sum above into the contribution from the output of each
individual head in layer 0.We omit a previous token head for visual
presentation. Under this lens, we see each head performing a relatively low
rank computation akin to a classification.

[IMAGE]The individual outputs of 4 important Layer 0 heads on one prompt projected
onto the character count probes.

How do individual heads implement this behavior? We can break down the
behavior of an individual head by analyzing its QK circuit (where it attends)
and OV circuit (the linear transformation from the embeddings to the output) .

QK Circuit. Each head h uses the previous newline as an “attention sink,” such
that for some number of tokens after the newline (s_h), the head just attends
to the newline. After s_h tokens, the head begins to smear its attention over
its receptive field, which goes up to a maximum of r_h tokens.

[IMAGE]The average attention to the previous newline as a function of the token
index in the line. Like boundary heads, these counting heads specialize with
different positional offsets.

OV Circuit. The OV circuit coordinates with the QK circuit to create a
heuristic estimate based on the number of tokens in the line multiplied by the
average token length (\mu_c \approx 4), with an additional length correction
term. When attending to the newline, each head upweights the average token
length multiplied by the head’s sink size: s_h\times\mu_c characters. If no
attention is paid to the newline, then from the perspective of the head, the
current token must be at least s_h+r_h tokens into the line and should
upweight (s_h+r_h) \times \mu_c character outputs. Finally, the OV circuit
applies an additional correction depending on whether the tokens in the
receptive field are above or below average in length.

Below, we include a detailed walkthrough of L0H1.

projected onto the character counting probes for 64 tokens of a single prompt
(truncated to the first newline). Bottom right: the attention pattern
(transposed of the canonical ordering). Top right: the average embedding
vectors projected onto the character count probes via the OV matrix. Bottom
right: a summary of the overall computation.

For a more detailed analysis of each head, see The Mechanics of Head
Specialization. Layer 1 attention heads perform a similar operation, but
additionally leverage the initial estimate of the character count (see Layer 1
Head OVs).

#### Computing the Line Width

To compute the line width, the model seems to use a similar distributed
counting algorithm to count the characters between adjacent newlines. However,
one subtlety that we do not address in this work is how the line width is
actually aggregated. It is possible that the model computes a global line
width by taking the max over all line lengths in the document or uses an
exponentially weighted moving average of the last several line lengths. We do
note that the line width uses a partially disjoint set of heads, likely
because the “attend to previous newline as a sink” mechanism needs
modification when the current token is also a newline.

### Visual Illusions

Humans are susceptible to “visual illusions” in which contextual cues can
modulate perception in seemingly unexpected ways. Famous examples include the
Müller-Lyer illusion, in which arrows placed on the ends of a line can alter
the perceived length of the line ; the Ponzo and Sander illusions which also
modulate perceived line length ; and others .

[IMAGE]Classic visual illusions in which perception of line-length is modulated.

Can we use our understanding of the character counting mechanism to construct
a “visual illusion” for language models?

To get started, we took the important attention heads for character counting
and investigated what other roles they perform on a wider data distribution.
We identified instances in which heads that normally attend from a newline to
the previous newline would instead attend from a newline to the two-character
string @@. This string occurs as a delimiter in git diffs, a circumstance in
which you might want to start your line count at a location other than the
newline:

⏎@@-14,30 +31,24 @@ export interface ClaudeCodeIAppTheme {⏎

But what happens when this sequence appears outside of a git diff context—for
instance, if we insert @@ in the aluminum prompt without changing the line
length?

[IMAGE]

We find that it does modulate the predicted next token, disrupting the newline
prediction! As predicted, the relevant heads get distracted: whereas with the
original prompt, the heads attend from newline to newline, in the altered
prompt, the heads also attend to the @@.

[IMAGE]Insertion of @@ ‘distracts’ an attention head which normally attends from \n
back to the previous \n. (left) Original attention pattern (truncated).
(right) Attention pattern (truncated) with @@ insertion. Now it also attends
back to the @@.

How specific is this result: does any pair of letters nonsensically inserted
into the prompt fully disrupt the newline prediction? We analyzed the impact
of inserting (at the same two positions) 180 different two-character
sequences, half of which were a repeated character. We found that while most
inserted sequences moderately impact the probability of predicting a newline,
newline usually remains the top prediction. There was also no clear difference
between sequences consisting of the same or different characters. However, a
few sequences substantially disrupted newline prediction, most of which
appeared to be related to code or delimiters of some kind: `` >> }} ;| || `,
@@.

We further analyzed the extent to which there was a relationship between
‘distraction’ of the important attention heads and the impact on the newline
prediction. Indeed we found that many of the sequences with potent modulation
of newline probability—and especially code-related character pairs—also
exhibited substantial modulation of attention patterns.

[IMAGE]Insertion of most pairs of characters only moderately impacts the probability
of predicting a newline. A subset of pairs, most of which appear related to
code or delimiters, substantially disrupt newline prediction. The impact on
newline prediction (originally 0.79) is correlated with how much inserted
tokens ‘distract’ character counting attention heads.

While in the aluminum prompt the task is implicit, this illusion generalizes
to settings where the comparison task is made explicit. These direct
comparisons are perhaps more analogous to the Ponzo, Sander, and Müller-Lyer
illusions, where the perception and comparison is more direct.

[IMAGE]

These effects are robust to multiple choice orderings. Moreover, if the length
of the text following the @@ exceeds that of the alternative choice, the
alternative choice is selected as being shorter.

While we are not claiming any direct analogy between illusions of human visual
perception and this alteration of line character count estimates, the
parallels are suggestive. In both cases we can see the broader phenomena of
contextual cues, and the application of learned priors about those cues,
modulating estimates of object properties of entities. In the human case,
priors such as three-dimensional perspective can influence perception of
object size, or color constancy can influence estimates of luminance (such as
in the checker shadow illusion). Here, one possible interpretation of our
results is that mis-application of a learned prior, including the role of cues
such as @@ in git diffs, can also modulate estimates of properties such as
line length.

### Related Work

Objective. This work is at the intersection of LLM “biology” (making empirical
observations about what is going on inside models; e.g. ) and low level
reverse engineering of neural networks (attempting to fully characterize an
algorithm or mechanism; e.g. ). Methodologically, our work makes heavy use of
attribution graphs  with QK attributions  built on top of crosscoders .

Linebreaking. Michaud et al.  identified linebreaking in fixed-width text as
one of the top 400 “quanta” of model behavior in the smallest model (70m
parameters) in the Pythia suite.

Position.  Prior interpretability work on positional mechanism has largely
focused on token position (e.g., ). These works have shown that there exist
MLP neurons , SAE features , and learned position embeddings  with periodic
structure encoding absolute token position. Our work illustrates how a model
might also want to construct non-token based position schemes that are more
natural for many downstream prediction tasks.

Others have also studied, even going back to LSTMs, the existence of
mechanisms in language models for controlling the length of output responses ,
as well as performed more theoretical analyses of the space of counting
algorithms .

Geometry and Feature Manifolds.  Beyond position, there has been extensive
work in understanding the geometric representation of numbers, especially in
toy models (e.g., ) and in the context of arithmetic in LLMs (e.g., ).
Collectively, these works have shown that both real LLMs and toy transformers
learn periodic representations , with numbers arranged in a helix to enable
certain matrix multiplication based addition algorithms , and that these
representations are provably optimal in certain settings . In our context, we
similarly observe helical representations , numeric dilation , and distributed
algorithms across components that collectively implement a correct computation
.

Multidimensional features with clear geometric structure have been found in
more natural contexts , like in the representation and computation of certain
ordinal relationships (e.g., months of the year). In vision models, curve
detector neurons  and features  have been especially well studied and closely
resemble the kind of discretization we observe with the families of character
counting features. Many other topics have received interpretability analysis
of the underlying geometry, such as grammatical relations , multilingual
representations , truth , binding , refusal , features , and hierarchy ,
though more conceptual research is needed .

Perhaps most relevant is recent work from Modell et al. , who provide a more
formal notion of a feature manifold, and propose that cosine similarity
encodes the intrinsic geometry of features. When testing their theory, they
observe highly structured and interpretable data manifolds that have ripples
and dilation, similar to our counting manifolds. These observations raise a
methodological challenge in how to best capture data with different structure
(see e.g. ), but also the exciting hypothesis that many naturally continuous
variables (e.g., ) exist in more organized manifolds.

Biological Analogues. The geometric and algorithmic patterns we observe have
suggestive parallels to perception in biological neural systems. Our character
count features are analogous to place cells on a 1-D track  and our boundary
detecting features are analogous to boundary cells . These features exhibit
dilation—representing increasingly large character counts activating over
increasingly large ranges—mirroring the dilation of number representations in
biological brains . Moreover, the organization of the features on a low
dimensional manifold is an instance of a common motif in biological cognition
(e.g., ). While the analogies are not perfect, we suspect that there is still
fruitful conceptual overlap from increased collaboration between neuroscience
and interpretability .

### Discussion

In this paper, we studied the steps involved in a large model performing a
naturalistic behavior. The linebreaking task, frequently encountered in
training, requires the model to represent and compute a number of scalar
quantities involving position in character count units that are not explicit
in its input or outputTokens do not come annotated with character counts, and
there are no vertical bars on the page showing the line width., then integrate
those values with the outputs of complex semantic circuits (that predict the
next proper word) to predict the next token. We found sparse features
corresponding to each important step of the computation, and for those steps
involving scalar quantities, we were able to find a geometric description that
significantly simplified the interpretation of the algorithm used by the
model. We now reflect on what we learned from that process:

Naturalistic Behavior and Sensory Processing. Deep mechanistic case studies
benefit from choosing behaviors that the model performs consistently well, as
these are more likely to have crisper mechanisms. This means prioritizing
tasks that are natural in pretraining over tasks that seem natural to human
investigators, and ideally, that are easily supervisable. As in biological
neuroscience, perceptual tasks are often both natural and easy to supervise
for interpretability (e.g., it is easy to modify the input in a programmatic
way). Although we sometimes describe the early layers of language models as
responsible for “detokenizing” the input , it is perhaps more evocative to
think of this as perception. The beginning of the model is really responsible
for seeing the input, and much of the early circuitry is in service of sensing
or perceiving the text similar to how early layers in vision models implement
low level perception .

The Utility of Geometry. Many of the representations and computations we
studied had elegant geometric interpretations. For example, the counting
manifolds are the result of an optimal tradeoff between capacity and
resolution, with deep connections to space-filling curves and Fourier
features. The boundary head twist was especially beautiful, and after
discovering one such head, we were able to correctly predict that there would
need to be additional heads to provide curvature in the output. The
distributed character counting algorithm was more complex, but we were still
able to clarify our view by studying linear actions on these manifolds. For
other computations, like the final breaking decision, the linear separation
was clearly a part of the story but there must be some additional complexity
we were not able to see yet to handle multitoken outputs. For the more
semantic operations, we purely relied on the feature view. Of course,
describing any behavior in full is immensely complicated, and there is a long
list of possible subtleties we did not study: how the model accounts for
uncertainty in its counting, its mechanism for estimating the line width given
multiple prior lines of text, how it adapts to documents with variable line
width, how it handles multiple plausible output tokens of different lengths or
multitoken words, or various special cases (e.g., a LaTeX \footnote{} or a
markdown link). For the inspired, we share transcoder attribution graphs for a
fixed-width line break prompt on [Gemma 2
2B](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gemma-2-2b/graph?slug=fourscoreandseve-1757368139332&pruningThreshold=0.8&densityThreshold=0.99&pinnedIds=14_19999_37&clerps=%5B%5B%2214_200290090_37%22%2C%22nearing+end+of+the+line%22%5D%5D)
and [Qwen 3

using the new neuronpedia interactive interface.

Unsupervised Discovery. It likely would not have been possible to develop this
clarity if it were not for the unsupervised sparse features. In fact, when we
started this project, we attempted to just probe and patch our way to
understanding, but this turned out poorly. Specifically, we did not understand
what we were looking for (e.g. we didn’t know to distinguish line width vs.
character count), where to look for it (e.g., we didn’t expect line width to
only be represented on the newline), or how to look for it (we started by
training 1-D linear regression probes). However, after identifying some
relevant features but before spending substantial effort systematically
characterizing their activity profiles, we were also confused by what they
were representing. We saw dozens of features that were vaguely about newlines
and linebroken text, but their differences were not obvious from flipping
through the activating examples. Only after we tested these features on
synthetic datasets did their role in the graph and the underlying computation
become clear. We suspect better automatic labels  enhanced with agentic
workflows  would accelerate this work, especially in less verifiable domains.

Feature-Manifold Duality. ​​The discrete feature and geometric feature-
manifold perspectives offer dual lenses on the same underlying object. For
example, in this work the model's representation of character count can be
completely described (modulo reconstruction error) by the activities of the
features we identified, where the action of the boundary heads is described by
virtual weights that expand out the feature interactions via attention head
matrices. The same character count representation can be described by a
1-dimensional feature manifold – a curve in the residual stream parametrized
by the character count variable – where linear action of the boundary heads is
described by continuous “twisting” of the manifold. In general, geometric
structures learned by the model will likely admit both global parametrizations
and local discrete approximations.

The Complexity Tax. Despite this duality, the descriptions produced by the two
perspectives differ in their simplicity. The discrete features shatter the
model into many pieces, producing a complex understanding of the computation.
This seems like a general lesson. It seems like discrete features and
attribution graphs may provide a true description of model computation, which
can be found in an automated way using dictionary learning. Getting any true,
understandable description of the computation is a very non-trivial victory!
However, if we stop there, and don't understand additional structure which is
present, we pay a complexity tax, where we understand things in a needlessly
complicated way. In the line breaking problem, constructing the manifold paid
down this tax, but one could imagine other ways of reducing the interpretation
burden.

A Call for Methodology. Armed with our feature understanding, we were able to
directly search for the relevant geometric structures. This was an existence
proof more than a general recipe, and we need methods that can automatically
surface simpler structures to pay down the complexity tax. In our setting,
this meant studying feature manifolds, and it would be nice to see
unsupervised approaches to detecting them. In other cases we will need yet
other tools to reduce the interpretation burden, like finding hierarchical
representations  or macroscopic structure  in the global weights .

A Call for Biology. The model must perform other elegant computations. We can
find these by starting with a specific task the model performs well, study
this from multiple perspectives, develop methodology to answer the remaining
questions, and relentlessly attempt to simplify our explanations. Because the
investigation is grounded in specific examples of a behavior, it provides a
fast feedback loop, can shed light on weaknesses of existing methods and
inspire new ones, and can sharpen our conceptual language for understanding
neural networks. We would be excited to see more deep case studies that adopt
this approach.

### Haiku Task Performance

Haiku is able to adapt to the line length for every value of k, predicting
newlines at the correct positions with high probability by the third line. Of
course, some error is to be expected even with a perfect estimate of line
length, as the model may incorrectly predict the next semantic token. Below is
the mean log-prob and accuracy for newline prediction of Haiku on 200 prose
sequences that were synthetically wrapped to have lines of character length k,
for k = 20, 40, \ldots, 140.

### Feature Splitting and Universality

It is natural to ask if the character counting features are fundamental, or
simply one discretization of the space among many. We found that dictionaries
of different sizes learn features with very similar receptive fields, so this
featurization – including the slowly dilating widths – is in some sense
canonical. We hypothesize that this canonical structure emerges from boundary
constraint: positions near zero (start of line) create a natural anchoring
point for feature development.

[IMAGE]

The geometry of the decoder directions is also fairly consistent between the
dictionaries, showing characteristic ringing.

[IMAGE]

However, we do see some evidence of feature splitting. For example, below are
three character count features which activate on the same interval (~20–45
characters in the line), but differentially activate for lines of different
widths: LCC2.a activates on all line widths, LCC2.b preferentially activates
on long line widths, and LCC2.c preferentially activates when close to the
line width boundary.

[IMAGE]

Recent work has raised the possibility that feature dictionaries could behave
pathologically where there exist feature manifolds , because a dictionary
could allocate an increasing number of features in a finer tiling of the
space. However, our observation that cross-coders of varying size tile this
feature manifold in a canonical way suggests that this behavior does not occur
in this setting.

### Line Width Features

Line width features tile the space similar to character count features.

### Dynamical System Model

We simulate N = 100 points on the unit (n-1)-sphere in \mathbb{R}^n (n \in
\\{3,\ldots,8\\}) with pairwise forces: \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \begin{cases}
\frac{1 - (d_{ij} - 1)/2}{r_{ij}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} & \text{when }d_{ij}
\leq w \\\ -\frac{\min(5, 1/r_{ij})}{r_{ij}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} &
\text{when }d_{ij} > w \end{cases}, where r_{ij} = \|\mathbf{x}_j -
\mathbf{x}_i\|, \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} = (\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}_i)/r_{ij},
w is the attractive zone width parameter, and d_{ij} = \min(|j-i|, |j-i+N|,
|j-i-N|) is the index distance (for the circular topology; for the interval it
is just d_{ij} = |j-i|). Evolution follows \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = \sum_{j \neq
i} \mathbf{F}_{ij} - 0.05\mathbf{v}_i and \dot{\mathbf{x}}_i = \mathbf{v}_i
with sphere constraint \mathbf{x}_i \leftarrow \mathbf{x}_i/\|\mathbf{x}_i\|
enforced after each timestep (\Delta t = 0.01, damping \alpha = 0.95).

### Analytic Construction of Ringing and Fourier Modes

We explore a deeper connection between the ringing observed in the character
count feature manifold, and a connection to Fourier analysis in an analytical
construction.

Suppose that we wish to have a discretized circle's worth of unit vectors,
each similar to its neighbors but orthogonal to those further away. Then the
cosine similarity matrix X of these will be the circulant matrix of a narrow-
peaked function f (left, below). The columns of the square root of X are n
vectors v_1,\ldots,v_n \in \mathbb{R}^n, where n is the number of discrete
points on the circle, whose inner products reproduce the similarity matrix.The
entire continuous circle embeds into the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space
L^2\mathbb{S^1} via this construction. Now suppose we would like to find
vectors in a lower-dimensional space whose similarity matrix approximates X,
like the model does for character counts. The best k-dimensional approximation
of this similarity, in an L^2 sense, is given by taking the eigendecomposition
of X and truncating it to the top k eigenvectors; the square root of the
result will provide n vectors in k-dimensions with the corresponding
similarity pattern. If \pi_k is the projector onto the span of the top k
eigenvectors, then the images \pi_k v_i, which live in a k-dimensional
subspace, are precisely those vectors. We can see below that the resulting
low-rank matrix has ringing ([colab
notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13L51UzyNQ6SnjNZRyhWsx_QuyQ3LoosW#scrollTo=c1q8ozayknvl)).
Finally, because the [discrete Fourier transform diagonalizes circulant
matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulant_matrix), the Fourier
coefficients of f are in fact the principal values of X; the low-rank
approximation consists of truncating the small Fourier coefficients of f; and
the resulting rows of X exhibit ringing.

One essential feature of the representation of line character counts is that
the “boundary head” twists the representation, enabling each count to pair
with a count slightly larger, indicating that the boundary is close. That is,
there is a linear map QK which slides the character count curve along itself.
Such an action is not admitted by generic high-curvature embeddings of the
circle or the interval like the ones in the physical model we constructed. But
it is present in both the manifold we observe in Haiku and, as we now show, in
the Fourier construction. First, note permutating the coordinates of
\mathbb{R}^n by taking e_i \mapsto e_{i+1} has the effect of mapping v_i
\mapsto v_{i+1}. That is, the (linear) action of this permutation \rho on
\mathbb{R}^n acts by a rotation of the embedded circle with respect to its
intrinsic geometry. Because conjugation by \rho fixes the circulant matrix X,
it therefore respects its eigendecomposition, and thus commutes with the
projection \pi_k onto the vector space spanned by its top k eigenvectors. The
restriction of \rho to that subspace, \overline{\rho}:=\pi_k \circ \rho \circ
\pi_k, acts by rotation on the lower-dimensional vectors \overline{\rho}:
\pi_k v_i \mapsto \pi_k v_{i+1}. Thus we have found n vectors in a
k-dimensional space, whose similarity is as close as possible to X (and has
ringing), with a linear action of \mathbb{R}^k that rotates the vectors along
a rippled embedded circle.

We evaluate whether a Fourier decomposition of the character count curve is
optimal, and find that it is quite close given that it does not account for
dilation. Fourier components explain at most 10% less variance than an
equivalent number of PCA components, which are optimal for capturing variance.

[IMAGE]

Finally, we note that as one moves through layers, the representation becomes
more peaked. This sharpening of the receptive field is useful to the model to
better estimate character counts, and corresponds to higher curvature in the
embedding and, as predicted by the model above, more pronounced ringing. Below
we show cross-sections (at character count 30, 60, 90, 120) of the cosine
similarity matrix of probes trained after layers 0, 1, 2, and 3. With each
subsequent layer, the graphs get more tightly peaked and secondary rings go
higher.

### Geometry of Twisting

Different heads access and manipulate the space in different ways. Below, we
show the cosine similarity of both probe sets through QK for three heads: one
which keeps them aligned, one which shifts character count to align better
with later line widths, and one which does the opposite.

[IMAGE]

We can also look at this transformation by visualizing the Singular Value
Decomposition of each set of probes in a joint basis after passing them
through QK. Once more, the alignment, left offset, and right offset can be
read directly from the components.

[IMAGE]

We can directly plot the first 3 components of the joint probe space after
passing them through each QK. Doing so shows that one head keeps the
representations aligned, while the others twist them either clockwise or
counterclockwise.

[IMAGE]

### Break Predictor Features

Boundary detector features (at about ~⅓ model depth) do not take into account
the length of the next token.

[IMAGE]

Later in the model, there exist features which incorporate both the number of
characters remaining and the length of the most likely next token. These
features only activate when the most likely next token is longer than the
number of characters remaining (i.e. below the red diagonal below), as is the
case in our aluminum prompt.

[IMAGE]

We also found features for the converse: features which suppress the newline
because the predicted next token is shorter than the number of characters
remaining in the line.

[IMAGE]

Both break prediction and suppression features sometimes also have
interpretable logit effects on the output of all tokens, not just the newline.
For instance, the features below respectively excite and suppress the newline
as their top effect, but also systematically suppress tokens with more
characters. This is because if the model is wrong about the value of the next
token (and whether it's a newline), the token must at least be short enough to
fit on the line.

[IMAGE]

### Representing Token Lengths

We find layer 0 features that activate as a function of the character count of
individual tokens.

[IMAGE]

These features are overlapping (e.g. there are tokens for which the long word
and medium word features are both active) and non-exhaustive (none of them
fire on some common tokens, where we suspect the representation of character
length is partially absorbed  into features which just activate for that
token).

### The Mechanics of Head Specialization

Heads collaborate to generate the count manifold, but how does each head
aggregate counts?

As a toy model, consider the following construction for character counting
with a single attention head:

  * The head uses the previous newline token as a “sink” where it defaults all of its attention to (i.e., attention 1)
  * Each token since the newline gets \alpha attention, such that after j tokens the newline has 1 - \alpha j attention. Note this limits the construction to only work on lines of up to 1 / \alpha tokens, but the model could use multiple heads at different offsets to count for longer sequences. The model could also dedicate attention to tokens proportionally to token length
  * The output of the head on the newline is 0, and the output of each non-newline token is a vector with the same direction but magnitude proportional to the character count of the token.

This produces a ray with total length proportional to the character count of
the line.

[IMAGE]

In practice, we observe that individual attention heads do indeed use the
newline as an attention sink, but at different offsets. As an example, we
visualize the attention patterns of 4 important Layer 0 heads on several
prompts with different line widths (starting from the first newline in the
sequence).

[IMAGE]Attention patterns of four important Layer 0 heads (columns) for 3 different
prompts (rows) prompt showing head specialization. Patterns start from the
first newline with red dashes indicating linebreaks.

To characterize the mechanism more precisely, we compute the average attention
as a function of the number of tokens since the previous newline and also as a
function of the character length of individual tokens.

[IMAGE]Normalized attention as a function of tokens since newline (left) and token
character length (right) for four heads. Each head specialized in a different
offset similar to boundary heads.

Similar to boundary detection, individual attention heads specialize in
particular offsets to tile the space. Moreover, we observe that most of these
attention heads have a bias towards attending to longer tokens.

In addition to QK, a head can change its output based on the OV circuit . We
study this by analyzing the pairwise interaction of probes as mediated by the
OV matrix. Specifically, for the averaged token embedding vectors for each
token length E_t That is, for each token character length i, we compute the
average embedding vector in W_E. We also prepend this with the newline
embedding vector to make the plot below., our line length probes P_c, and the
weight matrices for the attention output of each head W_{OV}, we compute P_c^T
W_{OV} E_t.

[IMAGE]Inner product of line character count and token character count through OV
for 4 important layer 0 heads. The OV responses reflect the difference in
attention pattern biases.

The output of each head can be thought of as having two components: (1) a
character offset from the newline driven by the attention pattern and (2) an
adjustment based on the actual character length of the tokens. Note that the
average character count of a token is approximately 4.5 (and the median is 4),
so we can interpret these effects shifting from a mean response (i.e. the
transition point is always around count 4).

To walk through a head in action, consider the perspective of L0H1, which
attends to the newline for the first ~4 tokens and then spreads out attention
over the previous ~4–8 tokens:

  * While attending to the newline, L0H1 writes to the 5–20 character count (5–20CC) directions and suppresses the 30–80CC directions. This makes sense as an approximation because attending to the newline implies that the line is currently at most 3 tokens long (newline has no width) and on average, any 3 token span is ~15 characters (and is unlikely to be >30). 
  * While not attending to the newline at all, L0H1 defaults to predicting CC40, since not attending to the newline implies that there are ~8 tokens in the line with ~5 characters each on average (including spaces). Then, there is an additional correction applied depending on how long the tokens are:

  * (1) If tokens being attended to are short (<4 chars), then upweight 10–35CC and downweight >40CC.
  * (2) If tokens being attended to are long (≥5 chars) then do the opposite.

  * In cases with some attention on newlines and nonnewlines, linearly interpolate the above predictions.

Other heads perform a similar operation, except with different offsets
depending on their newline sink behavior. Layer 1 heads also perform a similar
operation, though they also can leverage the character count estimate of the
Layer 0 heads (see Layer 1 Head OVs).

### Layer 1 Head OVs

Similar to the OVs of the Layer 0 attention heads, Layer 1 heads write to the
character count features in accordance to how long the tokens they attend to
are.

[IMAGE]

However, in addition to the token character length, Layer 1 heads also use the
initial line length estimate constructed in Layer 0 to create a more refined
estimate of the character count.

[IMAGE]

These repeated computations appear responsible for implementing the sharpening
of representations.

As before, we can look at their decomposition.

### More Sensory and Counting Representations

While in this work we carefully studied the perception of line lengths and
fixed width text, there are many tasks which language models must perform
which benefit from a positional, visual, or spatial representation of the
underlying text. In the course of our investigation, we came across several
other feature families and representations for these behaviors and report
several below.

#### What Follows an Early Linebreak?

In addition to line width for tracking the absolute character length of a full
line of text, there also exist features that are sensitive to lines which have
ended early (i.e., lines where the character count is substantially shorter
than the line width k). While these features are less useful for linebreaking,
they enable the model to better predict the token following a linebreak.
Specifically, if a line ends c characters before the line limit k, the next
word should be at least c characters, otherwise it would have been able to fit
in the previous line.

was broken.

It is worth emphasizing that the role of these features, like others in this
work, is not obvious from a typical workflow of quickly looking at dataset
examples. It might be tempting to ignore these as "newline" features, but
careful analysis yields quite clear behavior.

#### Markdown Table Representations

In addition to prose, language models must parse other kinds of more
structured data like tables. Accurate prediction of a table’s content requires
careful integration of row and column information (e.g. is this a column of
text or numbers?). To facilitate this, we use a synthetic dataset of 20
markdown tables to find feature families which activate on separator tokens,
specialized to particular rows or columns. Visualizing feature activations on
each of these 20 tables (arranged by location in the table) showed clear
patterns.

for 20 tables on the "|" token in the first column of the nth row.

shown for 20 tables on the "|" tokens in the nth column.

On a synthetic dataset of larger tables, we also observe counting
representations for the column and row index that resemble the character
counting representations. Specifically, we see ringing in the pairwise probe
cosine similarities and the characteristic “baseball seam” in the PCA basis.
